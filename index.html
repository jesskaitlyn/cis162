<p>Hello! I am sixteen years old and I am an incoming senior at Santa Fe High School. I hope to attend UCSD, where I will major in Computer Science. Outside of school, I am Miss Santa Fe Springs and a volunteer at the Columbia Memorial Space Center. The Miss Santa Fe Springs program represent the city and the Abigail Barraza Foundation, a nonprofit orginization that strives tp bring awareness to breast cancer and support those affected by it. By taking on a representative role, I hope to inspire and encourage girls in STEM by showing them they can conquer a male dominated field! </p>
